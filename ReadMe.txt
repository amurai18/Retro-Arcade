How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
I am very pleased with what I accomplished because I learned many new things in Inform, such as scoring, light and dark, hidden objects, etc.  I think that the player should have an easy time understanding the objective and where the objects are if they read the hints and dialogue.  I also think that I provided enough synonyms, so that a player won’t get stuck just because they don’t write it exactly how I wrote it.  I also added new actions and certain rules, so that if a player tries to, for example, play with the phone, I wrote it so that it says, “You shouldn’t play with your phone”, etc.  I think that the puzzles are challenging but doable because they are almost all finding puzzles, meaning the objects are hidden and through examining things and getting hints, the player can find them.  
Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
I was having trouble with writing the part where the player places the paddles and puck on the table, and inserts the quarter, but I didn’t know how to create a place to insert the quarter, or how to make it so the player can place the paddles or puck on top of the table.  I then got help from Mr. and Mrs. Kiang and the Inform handbook by Jim Aikins, and eventually made the table a supporter and created a coin slot as a container.  Therefore, the player can insert the quarter, and put the paddles and puck on the table to turn it on, and get a hint for the electric box key.  
Describe each of three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.
The first thing to do is look in your inventory and turn on the flashlight.  Then, you have to take the pager to get a hint on what to do.  Then, you examine the arcade machines, and when you get to pac man, it says that there is something by the controls.  After that, you can examine the controls to see that there is a quarter next to it (take it).  Then, the pager hints toward going to the party room to the East, and looking behind the boxes to reveal the paddles.  Then, you go to the bathroom that is West of the Main Arcade Room, to examine the sink, which reveals a puck that looks like a bar of soap.  Then, you have to go to the Hockey Table Room and then put the paddles and puck on top of the table and insert the quarter into the coin slot to get a hint that the power needs to be turned on.  You then go to the food counter and look behind it to reveal a key for the electric box, which is in the back alley.  After you unlock the box with the key, you win and the game ends.
Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.
I feel like this is a good starting game for people that haven’t played inform before.  I think that it covers the basics of inform and also introduces somethings that get them interested.  The puzzles are pretty self explanatory, as they are “hide-and-seek” puzzles.  The player has to find the items, but they are given some hints if they take the pager or read.  I also include possible exits so that the player knows where they are and where they can go.  I first describe the map when the player turns on the flashlight and enters the main arcade room, they get a description of the whole map and what is where.  The descriptions give a 80’s, retro arcade vibe to it and I think the challenge is okay.  
Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 
My classmates beta tested my game and they showed me that it was lacking description and hints on what to do.  Also, they gave me lots of synonyms to code for.  If it weren’t for that, I think that I would have gotten the player stuck a lot and confused.  
How did their feedback affect your game? 
I think it really helped me find all the loop holes and synonyms to add and to add more mechanics to add in order to make the objective clearer.  I think when they got stuck, it helped me understand what was wrong, or what was too hard to find.  I think Shane’s advice that it was fun to find the objects helped me focus on what was important and helped me get rid of useless stuff.  
Whose game did you beta test? 
Jackie and Shane’s.
What feedback were you able to give?
I was able to give some insight on what was confusing and what puzzles were too difficult.  Also, I said that some of the objects that were described weren’t able to examine or interact with.  
What are you most proud of?
I’m most proud of the amount of description I had.  I think a lot of objects, scenery and rooms have the amount of description to paint a picture and immerse the player into the game.  Also, I think I give some hints that don’t give away too much.  Also, the amount of new things I implemented into my game.  Although I had a hard time getting rid of errors, I think that I learned a lot about working around bugs in the code through use of language, and asking others.  I learned that it’s okay to ask for help if you get stuck. 
What would you do differently next time?
I would defiantly devote more time to working on it, and asking others more for help.  I think that I had the potential to create a way more polished, clearer game.
